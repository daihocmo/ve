Learn to draw and paint
=======================

14--18 minutes

* * * * *

**Play** with child-like wonder
-------------------------------

Do what pleases you from time to time, and draw what you like. Practice composition, new techniques, and new mediums. Explore what you learn with personal projects.

**Observe** like a painter
--------------------------

Sculpt your images. Practice shape design (painting, expressive pencil drawing). Watch and listen to [Marco Bucci](https://www.youtube.com/user/marcobucci) and [Sinix](https://www.youtube.com/user/sinixdesign) to elarn more.

**Think** like a draftsman
--------------------------

Balance the rest by studying hard principles to elevate your creative exploration. Watch and listen to [Scott Robertson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrJhSmz4zo9t-Z2GdHECW7A), [Feng Zhu](https://www.youtube.com/user/FZDSCHOOL), and [Kim Jung Gi](https://www.kimjunggius.com/) to elarn more.

Navigating the **curriculum**
-----------------------------

The curriculum is based on the struture of Marc Brunet's "ARTSchool", so if you like it you may want to check out his own course.\
Overall however, the Solo Artist curriculum has a much higher emphasis on

Perspective and Draftsmanship
-----------------------------

You may find the subject material front unit to unit seemingly random. This is by design - so that you don't go mad driling perspective for 2 months at a time.

If you want to swap a unit or term around feel free to do so. This is merely a guide for a structural approach to self-teaching.

The intended purpose is to balance a foundation of technical perspective and creative learning, so that you may learn to draw anything from imagination.

**2 years** and **3 months**
----------------------------

is how long you should expect to stick with the Solo Artis curriculum

**9 terms** in total

**3 units** per term

**4 weeks** per unit

Feel free to divide this curriculum to take however long you'd wish. I've planned it this way to provide a tangible structure for how long to stay on each unit before moving on.

I might switch out the Proko stuff at the beginning and go through Michael Hampton's *Analytical Figure Drawing* instead, though I'm willing to be convinced otherwise*.* Thoughts on going through Peter Han's *Dynamic Sketching* instead of *Drawabox*? When it comes to composition, another fantastic challenge that could be added is something like 30 days of composition studies from [film grab](https://www.film-grab.com) and another for landscape/environment from [map crunch](https://www.mapcrunch.com).
